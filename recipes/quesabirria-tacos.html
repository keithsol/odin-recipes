        <h2>Mouth-drooling Quesabirria Tacos</h2>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>7-8 cups hot water</li>
            <li>4 lbs chuck roast, cut into 4 large chunks</li>
            <li>2 lbs short ribs (bone in), or back ribs bone in</li>
            <li>1 large white onion, dry skins removed, cut in half crosswise</li>
            <li>1 garlic bulb, cut the narrow top off, no need to peel</li>
            <li>1 carrot, cut in half crosswise, then cut in half (4 large pieces of carrot)</li>
            <li>5 bay leaves, dried</li>
            <li>8 guajillo chiles, stems cut off and seeds removed</li>
            <li>3 tbsp chicken boullion</li>
            <li>1-2 tsp chili powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp mexican oregano</li>
            <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt, (adjust to taste)</li>
            <li>14-16 white corn tortillas</li>
            <li>2 cups quesadilla cheese, or any good melting cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine Ingredients: In large pot add meat, onion, garlic, carrots, bay leaves and dried peppers. Cover with water. (This uses my large 7 qt pot and fills it to the top!)</li>
            <li>Add Seasonings: Add chicken bouillon, oregano, cumin and salt, stir to combine. Bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Skim: After 30 minutes, skim the top of the pot to remove impurities from the bone cooking out. (will look like little bits of foam on the top)</li>
            <li>Blend Peppers: Remove the peppers (should be softened) and place in a blender or food processor. Blend until smooth, add up to 1/4 cup of broth if needed to help get a smooth consistency. </li>
            <li>Strain: Strain the peppers if needed to remove bits of skin (if using a high powered blender this step is not necessary). </li>
            <li>Combine: Add the blended peppers into the broth and stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Season: Add in the chili powder as desired to get a nice deep red color to the broth.</li>
            <li>Simmer: Cover and continue to simmer for about 3 hours or until meat is tender and easily shredding on it's own. (remove lid and give a stir every 40 minutes or so. Can also taste the broth once the meat is cooked through and adjust seasonings as needed).</li>
            <li>Reserve Grease: Skim the grease from the top of the broth (SAVE THIS!) pour the grease into a small skillet or saucepan, this is used for making the tacos if desired. </li>
            <li>Remove the onion, garlic, carrots, and bay leaves from the broth. (these ingredients were in the broth for flavoringâ€¦people are more than welcome to eat and enjoy them, so save them if you want!)</li>
            <li>Serving: Remove the meat from the broth and cut into large chunks for serving. Remove any bones. </li>
        </ol>
